	<description>Use the given path as a clipping path, or the current path if no path was given.  Everything drawn after a clipPath() call will be clipped by the clipping path. To “undo” the clipping later, make sure you do the clipping inside a with savedState(): blockent path, or draw the provided path.</description>
