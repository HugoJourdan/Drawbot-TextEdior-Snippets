  <description>A radial gradient fill with:  startPoint as (x, y) endPoint as (x, y) colors as a list of colors, described similary as fill locations of each color as a list of floats. (optionally) startRadius radius around the startPoint in degrees (optionally) endRadius radius around the endPoint in degrees (optionally) Setting a gradient will ignore the fill.</description>
